# LSTM Classifier for Korean Legal Documents

## Introduction

Studies have tested the effectiveness of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) for classification of legal
documents in the United States. This study tests its effectiveness for South Korean legal document
classification, using 14,526 compensation records and 9,271 tax law precedent records collected from the
library of the Supreme Court of South Korea. The documents were preprocessed using the KoNLP Okt Korean
morpheme analyzer and classified using a sequential model constructed with the Keras Python deep learning
library. The LSTM sequential model provided 60% accuracy, but may be able to improve on this result with
more refined data. This suggests that LSTM may be useful for document classification and information retrieval
in the South Korean legal system.
